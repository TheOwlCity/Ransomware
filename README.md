# Ransomware
Ransomware developed for education purposes, do not use it for malicious or non authorized actions.

There is a safe question which the answer to start the attack is "start", use at your own risk. Any different answer/input will quit the attack.

As I created it for educational purposes only, the directory to attack points to a test directory I create. You can change the path to the one you desire.

Use it safely.â™¡
